- Goal
  - Imagine a student searching for keywords (e.g. political violence) and all the professors who have political violence in their profile (scraped from personal and university profile) and research paper title (scraped from google scholar) includes a given keyword. 
- What is the problem? 
  - When a student (or, any individual) is looking for professors based on their research interest, they have to go through all the faculty list for each university.

- What is this repo about?
  - This is a scraper to scrape professors across the US universities. All you need is to add a proper follow pattern to for a given school or faculty. Then we can make another repo to build an API. Finally, another repo for a web application. 

- Why is this project paused?
  - I am engulfed in another project at the moment and I do not know why I wanted to embark on this project. However, this is a very amazing opportunity. Please let me know if you want to work on it together.
